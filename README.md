# Memory Types 

## Overview
The `memoryTypes` smart contract is a simple Solidity contract that illustrates the use of memory variable types. It includes functions to perform a basic summation of two numbers and to update the balance variable.

## Functions

### 1. Sum Function
The `sum` function takes two `uint` parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns their sum (`z`). The local variable `z` is used to demonstrate the memory variable type in Solidity.

### 2. Update Function
The `update` function allows updating the `balance` variable with the provided `value`. This function showcases the storage variable type, which persists values across function calls.

## Usage
1. Deploy the contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Call the `sum` function with two uint parameters to see the use of memory variables.
3. Call the `update` function to update the `balance` variable.
